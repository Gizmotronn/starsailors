* It is used to create computer programs
* *C++ is derived from C, and is largely based on it*

### Hello, world!
* A C++ program is a series of commands or statements
* #include <iostream> - C++ offers many headers, each of which contains information needed for programs to work properly
* The program at Code Examples\Hello World needs the <iostream> header
* The number sign (#) at the beginning of a line targets the compiler's pre-processor
* In this case, #include tells the pre-processor to include the <iostream> header
* *The <iostream> header defines the standard stream objects that input and output data*
