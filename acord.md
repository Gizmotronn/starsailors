## Computer Science

I'm currently doing a computer science course at school, and I'm aiming to get into a Software Engineering course at university. To code Star Sailors, I'll be needing to learn the following coding languages:

* HTML
* CSS
* Python
* PHP
* Java & Javascript
* C, C#, C++

I'll be starting with Python for 2 reasons:

* I know how to code basic things in Python (and it is needed)
* In August we'll be doing Python in school

Because of this, I'll be learning all about Python and how to use it. There are 2 repos that I will be sharing my knowledge, notes and basic code:

[DroidOS Python Repo](http://irisdroidology.github.io/droidos-python)
[Star Sailors Repo](http://acord-robotics.github.io/starsailors/python/)

I'll be storing it here as well as on my personal Github account.
