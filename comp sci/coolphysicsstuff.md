Liam Arbuckle – Physics Assessment 2 – Practical Report
9th April 2019
Aim
To discover the strength of different frequencies of tuning forks when held against a closed pipe.
Hypothesis
As the frequency increases, the distance that the tuning fork will be from the pipe to be heard will decrease.
Equipment
•	Several pipes (open) – varying lengths
•	2 liters water
•	Tub (to hold the water)
•	Tuning forks (A, B, C, D?)
•	Sharpie
Method
1.	Choose a pipe
2.	Pour 2 liters of water into the tub
3.	Submerge the pipe into the tub at a 90-degree angle with the bottom of the tub
4.	Activate a tuning fork and hold it towards the rim of the pipe
5.	Move the tuning fork away from the pipe slowly until you can hear the sound
6.	Repeat steps 4 and 5 with different tuning forks
7.	Repeat steps 3-6 with different pipes
Results:
Frequency of Tuning Fork (hz)	Length (cm) of tuning fork from pipe mouth
640 - D	12.4
440 - A	27.5
384 – G	20.7
312 - E	16.5
256 - C	32.5

Results (in order of distance of tuning fork from pipe mouth):
Frequency of Tuning Fork (hz)	Length (cm) of tuning fork from pipe mouth
640 - D	12.4
312 - E	16.5 
384 – G	20.7
440 - A	27.5
256 - C	32.5

Discussion
I stated in my hypothesis that the higher the frequency of the tuning fork, the closer it could be to the pipe for the sound to be heard. Looking at the results, we can see that my hypothesis wasn’t correct. While the largest distance was the lowest frequency (C – 256 hz), the second shortest distance belonged to the second lowest frequency (E – 312 hz). The largest distance between the tuning fork being heard and the open pipe was 27.5 cm, and that belonged to the second highest frequency (A – 440 hz). As we can see in the second table, the results were mixed around. This can be expressed as follows:
•	Highest frequency
•	4th highest frequency
•	3rd highest frequency
•	2nd highest frequency’
•	Lowest frequency
As shown, three of the frequencies behaved as I believed they would before starting the experiment – the D, G, and C forks. However, the E & A forks were switched around from where I would’ve expected them to be based on my hypothesis.
Conclusion
There are some inaccuracies to be expected with this experiment. All the groups were doing the experiment in the same room, and because of this it got quite noisy. We may not have heard the sound from the tuning fork as a result. Also, the measurements of the distances may not have been accurate, because of the awkward way we had to hold the fork and the ruler. 
Because of all this, while some of the results from the experiment fitted in with my hypothesis, we would need to do the experiment over again. It would also be good to compare the results of other groups, to see what they discovered.
