# Planning for Star Sailors Single Player

### Note:
* This version of Star Sailors will be a 'lite' version. This means that there will be no multiplayer to begin with and there will be no huge features

## Resources
* [RPG Playground](http://rpgplayground.com/play/)
* [Free Code Camp](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learning-javascript-by-making-a-game-4aca51ad9030)

## Purposes
* Learn how to code
* Learn which language to use
* Plan what will be in the game

## What do we need?
### Inventory System
* The inventory system will be accessible to each user
* Players can pick up items, which will be stored in the inventory
* Users can send items to each other's inventory
* Users can craft items in the inventory - users will craft crafting modules to craft different things (see in What do we need\Crafting Modules)

### Crafting Modules
* Ship crafting module & ship part module
* Robot crafting module
* Tech crafting module
* Weapons & armour crafting module
* Building crafting module (pre-installed)

### Player stat system
* Players earn XP (See What do we need\XP System)

### XP
* Players earn 1 xp for each item they craft
* Players earn anywhere from 2 xp to 10 xp for each monster they kill (doesn't include bosses) (depending on difficulty - see in What do we need\Monsters)

### Saving system
* Autosave every 5-10 minutes
* Players can save the game manually in the esc menu

### Monsters
* Monsters have a difficulty from 1-5. This affects the amount of XP that will be given out upon death

## What is the point of the game?
* Based on the Star Sailors novella - acord.allianceofdroids.org.au
* Users witness their homeworld destroyed
* Users pick a species
* Users fly around on ships, landing on planets, exploring them, killing monsters and collecting items
* Users meet NPCs, who introduce them to the Midgard Legacy (sort of the galactic senate of Star Sailors)
* Users build up an arsenal of weapons (can enhance them using items/xp found on their journey)
* Users find their home planet, free it in an epic battle that has 3 parts - space, water and land
* After this primary mission is completed, users can create a colony and manage their colony
* Users can expand their colony, produce new buildings, go on mini-missions for their colony's citizens
* Extra optional bosses
* Users can create space stations, planets, etc
* Users can capture monsters/aliens
* Item frames
* Fossils to collect
