description: ACORD has decided to move on from the Aardvark theme by Ghostpool, which we've used since March this year. We've moved to the Olympus theme, which is a very modern-looking template for Buddypress sites. Buddyboss (2016-17) >> Buddyapp (2017) >> Thrive (2018-19) >> Aardvark (2019) >> Olympus + Youzer (2019)

I was looking around for some good buddypress themes just out of interest on Wednesday or Thursday, and I came across a theme called "Olympus". Now, I had no real intentions of changing the theme of the ACORD website from Aardvark - it had, after all, served me pretty well. The only real problem I had with Aardvark was the header menu, but that could easily be fixed, and the other members of ACORD had no problem with it.

However, that all changed when I came across the Olympus theme.
