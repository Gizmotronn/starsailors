description: >
  To practice computer science and increase my development skills, I'm going to be creating a text-based Role Playing Game. It's going to be created using Python, and can be found on [Gitlab](http://gitlab.com/irisdroidology/expert-goggles) & [Github](http://github.com/irisdroidology/expert-goggles/). The Expert Goggles repo is my practice games and apps.
