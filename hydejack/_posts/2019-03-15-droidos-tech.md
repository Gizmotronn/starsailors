  DroidOS, the official operating system of ACORD Robotics, is undergoing a few changes at the moment. I'm going to be talking about the DroidOS Beta. I'm getting a new PC and a new phone over the next few weeks, so it will be a good chance to test out and develop DroidOS before released the public download. ACORD members can download DroidOS for free. For non-ACORD members, it will be $5 per repo - iOS, Android, Windows are currently being developed.
