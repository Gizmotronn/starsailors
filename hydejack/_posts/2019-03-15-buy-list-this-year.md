# Personal Items
## Ring

One of my friends from school, Fred, was telling me that his dad had given him a ring for his birthday. But it wasn't just any ring, it was a gear ring. These rings have gears along the outside and can be used in a similar way as a fidget cube.

For someone like me, this is perfect. Although they are quite expensive (over $300 AUD), they look really neat and I love jewelry. I have a few necklaces (including an R2-D2 one) and a few watches as well.

You may have gathered that I'm a huge Star Wars fan. This is another ring that I'd love to get.

## Lightsabers
On my 16th birthday, I got my first lightsaber from [Ultrasabers](http://ultrasabers.com). It was an Apprentice V3 with a blue 24" blade, and I'm already looking to add to my collection with 2 new items:

The first one will have a green blade and have sound, and the second one will be a stunt saber with a blue blade.

If you want a lightsaber, go with Ultrasabers. They have an extremely fast shipping time and make great-quality products.

## Everton 18-19 & 86-87 kit
Everton is a football club that plays in the top tier of the English Football Pyramid. They are the club that has spent the longest amount of time in the top flight, only being relegated twice. They're also the club I support.

I've got Everton's 08-09 kit, but I'm looking to get 2 more kits this year:

1986/87:

## Tech
### Samsung Gear S3

I'm a sucker for watches. Especially smart watches. Currently, I have an iPhone 5s, however as you may know I will be getting a Samsung S8 in 14 days. While I currently have a very good watch, I'm looking to buy a smart watch, and the Gear S3 looks like a good choice. It's cheap and has all the Android Wear apps that I want and need.

## Prices:
- Everton Shirts: $100
- Lightsabers: $400-$600
- R2-D2 Ring: $50
- Gear Ring: $100-$400
- Samsung Gear S3: $250
- [Star Wars: Droid Works (1998)](https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Droid-Works/dp/B00002SV6E)
- New ACORD domain name (either acord.io or acord.org.au): $15-$30/year
- R2-D2 Laptop skin: $30-$50
- [Fisher Space Pen](https://www.spacepen.com/chromebulletwithspaceshuttle.aspx): $60
- Planetary Society Curiosity Membership: $50

- Total: $800-$1300


All prices are in Australian Dollars. Currently 1 AUD = 0.72 USD. Obviously I'm probably not going to be able to purchase all of this this year. I'm planning to spread this out.

## The grand plan

- First $200 I earn this year: Straight into my bank
- Next $200: 70-30 ratio - 70% into bank, 30% spending money
- Next $400: 50-50 ratio: 50% into bank, 50% spending money
- Next $400: 30-70 ratio: 30% into bank, 70% spending money
- After this: 20-80 ratio: 20% into bank, 80% spending money

### Spending money plan
- 90-10 ratio: 90% goes towards items listed above, 10% goes into food, movies, music, etc

### 2019 Wishlist Ranks (What will I buy first?)
