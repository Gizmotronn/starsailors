## Ring

One of my friends from school, Fred, was telling me that his dad had given him a ring for his birthday. But it wasn't just any ring, it was a gear ring. These rings have gears along the outside and can be used in a similar way as a fidget cube.

For someone like me, this is perfect. Although they are quite expensive (over $300 AUD), they look really neat and I love jewelry. I have a few necklaces (including an R2-D2 one) and a few watches as well.

You may have gathered that I'm a huge Star Wars fan. This is another ring that I'd love to get.

## Lightsabers
On my 16th birthday, I got my first lightsaber from [Ultrasabers](http://ultrasabers.com). It was an Apprentice V3 with a blue 24" blade, and I'm already looking to add to my collection with 2 new items:

The first one will have a green blade and have sound, and the second one will be a stunt saber with a blue blade.

If you want a lightsaber, go with Ultrasabers. They have an extremely fast shipping time and make great-quality products.
