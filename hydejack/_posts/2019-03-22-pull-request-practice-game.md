  Python, a popular programming language, is going to be the first language we
  use for creating Star Sailors. We're going to see how much we can do in Star

Star Sailors is going to be coded using a large number of coding languages, including:
* HTML
* Java
* CSS
* C++
* C#
* C
* and, of course, python

The new branch on the [github page](http://github.com/acord-robotics/starsailors/) will be the code for me testing out these coding languages for the start of the game, including the navigation and the menu.

Thanks Sololearn Discussion!
