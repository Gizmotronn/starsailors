## Prologue - Chapter 2
Humankind has fled Earth. Now it's on its way home, led by Opus S'iridium, the fleet commander. It's been a long time coming, but better late than never.

Opus begins to think what he'll do when he sets foot on Earth again. But he never gets the chance, because soon after entering the Sol System, he is attacked by an unidentified ship and whisked away in a flash of blinding light, along with the rest of the system.

Gilbert McInstay, a friend of Opus's, is named temporary 2IC (2nd in command)and discovers a message from an extraterrestrial being.

While the recovery of the fleet is being attempted in what was once the Sol System, aliens on the planet Midgardia are debating the event in the Galactic Parliament - the Midgard Legacy. After the senators elect to do something about the situation, the leader of the fleet sends a message to McInstay, which is where Chapter 1 ends. 

While the chapter structure of Star Sailors starts at the beginning and ends at the end, some of the book is written in reverse chronological order (for example, chapter 2 and chapter 1).

## Why did I start writing Star Sailors?
### Walk along Fremantle

Fremantle. The port of Western Australia. And until recently, a place I visited at least once a month (on the weekends) with my family. Whether it was for Pancakes at the Chalky's cafe in the morning, or a set of Spanish Donuts at San Churros, Fremantle was a time to walk and talk with the family (and recently, the dog, Elsie, who we insist on bringing with us for walks).
