  I came into Saturday, March 30th, expecting a Samsung S8. I walked out of the store with a Samsung S10e and an Otterbox case for it. It's a great device and will be used for testing out DroidOS features. I'll be talking about AnDroidOS, a possible name for it once it's released, what's on my phone, the story behind this phone, and much more. Enjoy!
