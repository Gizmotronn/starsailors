# Dev News - DROIDOS
## Sololearn
We recently hit our 6-day streak on Sololearn, meaning we had logged in and learnt some code for 6 days in a row. Over that period, we've learnt more of C++, so we are now about half-way through the basic concepts for C++.

## What tutorials will we be using for coding?
I've already mentioned Sololearn, which is a free-to-use website/app that has really great content and gives tutorials for 13 different languages, including C++, C, C#, Python, and Java. I banged through the HTML course on the way back from Brisbane (when I went to the Australian Space Design Finals), and I made notes (see DroidOS Development), however it didn't really stick in my memory. I think this is because of the way I made my notes and how rushed I was. I still understand the basics, and I'm going to be redoing that course.

I'm also looking for some other tutorial websites and other possible languages (see below).

## The future of DroidOS
As we had to change our name from Alliance of Droids to ACORD Robotics because of the word droid being trademarked, we're planning to also change the name of DroidOS. This name change will hopefully be in place by August across all platforms, however we've got a few possible names lined up:

* StellarOS
* RobOS
* AcordS
