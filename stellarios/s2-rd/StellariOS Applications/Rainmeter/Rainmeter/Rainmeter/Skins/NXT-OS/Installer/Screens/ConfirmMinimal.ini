Text=By chosing the minimal install option you understand that you are ONLY installing the NXT-OS sub-system. This option is meant for people who want to use a skin that was built for NXT-OS without using all parts of NXT-OS. This option will not replace your current rainmeter setup. Choosing this option means that only the NXT-OS system skins and the Notify service will be added to your existing Rainmeter layout.
