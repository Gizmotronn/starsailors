NOTICE:

	Thanks for taking the time to read this! This document is meant to 
	provide you with a comprehensive introduction to your new desktop. 

	For most people, the brief intro video (found here: 
	http://intro.win10widgets.com/) can be consumed quicker and is a more 
	useful experience. However, if you don't have a stable internet 
	connection or simply prefer to read, look ahead to learn more about 
	what Win10 Widgets can do for you!

About:

	Your desk has more on it than a bunch of folders and files, why should
	your computer desktop be any different?
	
	Win10 Widgets transforms your desktop from a collection of folders and
	files to a place where you can find all the information you need, when
	you need it. Weather, WiFi, battery, music, and more; all available at
	a glance. 
	
	Plus it looks cool! Like those futuristic computers you always see in 
	the movies (we're looking at you, Iron Man and Minority Report).
	
	Unlike widgets before it, Win10 Widgets blends into the background and 
	makes the information you need the focus of your experience. By 
	starting from scratch and engineering each widget with an emphasis on 
	functional simplicity, Win10 Widgets adapts to you instead of the 
	other way around. Win10 Widgets works with any wallpaper, any screen 
	size, and uses your unique Windows 10 accent color to adapt to the 
	personalized experience you've already created. 

	Best of all, there are no programming skills required; everything just 
	works!

Welcome Widget:

	The first thing you'll see when you load Win10 Widgets is the Welcome 
	widget. If you've already closed it, no worries! You can always bring 
	it back by right-clicking the Rainmeter "raindrop" icon in the 
	notification area (i.e. system tray), selecting 
	"Skins" -> "Win10 Widgets" -> "Welcome", and clicking "Welcome.ini".

	The Welcome widget is where you have the option to read this document, 
	watch an intro video, and/or perform a few other actions that are 
	outlined below:

	Updates! (the green button)

		The first button (the green one) gives you the ability to receive 
		notifications about future Win10 Widgets updates, tutorials, and 
		new widgets as soon as they're released. To subscribe, simply 
		click the green "Send Me Updates!" button and you will be 
		redirected to a website where you can sign up.

		The Win10 Widgets privacy policy is simple: 
		"No spam. No sharing your email. Ever. Period."

		You aren't required to sign up, however it is strongly encouraged. 
		If you don't sign up, you'll miss out on all the awesome 
		features coming in the the next version of Win10 Widgets!
	
	Donate :) (the purple button)

		The second button (the purple one) gives you the ability to donate 
		to my college fund. If you enjoy my work and are looking for a way 
		to express your gratitude, please help me pay off my student 
		loans :)
		
		You can read more at http://donate.win10widgets.com
	
	Share! (the blue and red buttons)

		The rest of the buttons (the blue and red ones) give you the 
		ability to share Win10 Widgets on social media. If you enjoy your 
		new desktop, please consider sharing it with your friends; I'm 
		sure they'll appreciate the tip!
		
	To close the Welcome widget, simply click the "X" in the top right 
	corner.

	Remember, you can always bring the Welcome widget back by 
	right-clicking the Rainmeter "raindrop" icon in the notification area 
	(i.e. system tray), selecting "Skins" -> "Win10 Widgets" -> "Welcome", 
	and clicking "Welcome.ini". This is useful if you decide at some point 
	that you'd like to receive updates, donate to my college fund :), or 
	share Win10 Widgets on social media.
	
Adding/Removing Widgets:

	Adding and removing widgets is easy! To add a widget, start by 
	right-clicking the Rainmeter "raindrop" icon in the notification area 
	(i.e. system tray) and selecting "Skins" -> "Win10 Widgets". Next, 
	select the name of the widget you want to add and click the variation 
	(i.e. size) of your chosen widget to add it to your desktop.
	
	To remove a widget, simply right-click it and select "Unload skin." 
	
	If, for some reason, you cannot right-click the widget you want to 
	remove, right-click the Rainmeter "raindrop" icon in the notification 
	area (i.e. system tray), select the name of the widget you wish to 
	remove (e.g. "Win10 Widgets/DateTime"), and  select "Unload skin."

Changing Widget Size:

	Each widget offers a selection of various sizes. If you want to change 
	the size of a widget that is already on your desktop, simply 
	right-click the widget, select "Variants", and click the size you want 
	to use.

	If, for some reason, you cannot right-click the widget you want to 
	resize, right-click the Rainmeter "raindrop" icon in the notification 
	area (i.e. system tray), select the name of the widget you wish to 
	resize (e.g. "Win10 Widgets/DateTime"), select "Variants", and click 
	the size you want to use.
	
Positioning Widgets:

	To position a widget, simply click and drag it wherever you like. 
	Widgets will snap to the edge of your screen, unless this feature has 
	been disabled. To disable this option, right-click the widget, select 
	"Settings", and click the "Snap-to-edges" option. The same steps can 
	be followed to re-enable this option.

	If your widgets aren't able to be dragged, make sure that the Lock 
	widget isn't in the "locked" state. To "unlock" the lock widget, 
	simply click it. For more information about the Lock widget, please 
	see the "Special widgets" section below.

Widget Options:

	Several widgets offer options that allow you to change how the 
	information provided by the widget is displayed. These options can be 
	found by right-clicking on the widget and looking under the header 
	"Custom skin actions".
	
	Some examples of these options include:
	
	- Date/Time widget:
		- 12-hour time
		- 24-hour time
	- HardDrive widget:
		- Auto-select drive
		- Select from available drives
	- WiFi widget:
		- Show % signal strength
		- Hide % signal strength
	- Lock:
		- Light icon
		- Dark icon
		- Help
	- Weather:
		- Auto-location
		- Set location
		- Imperial units (F)
		- Metric units (C)
		- 12-hour time
		- 24-hour time

	If, for some reason, you cannot right-click the widget you want to 
	view the options for, right-click the Rainmeter "raindrop" icon in the 
	notification area (i.e. system tray), select the name of the widget 
	you wish to view the options for (e.g. "Win10 Widgets/DateTime"), and 
	look under the header "Custom skin actions".

Special Widgets:

	The "Lock" and "LayoutSwitcher" widgets are a little different than 
	the other Win10 Widgets. If you need assistance with these widgets, 
	there is a "Help" option that can be found using the steps outlined in 
	the "Widget options" section above. Depending on the status of your 
	internet connection, the "Help" option will either direct you to a 
	YouTube video, or a text file like this one.


Thats it!
