You obviously need SpeedFan running for this panel to work:

To get SpeedFanNumber, open SpeedFan and look for the temperature readings. If you want to measure GPU temperature, you need to see where the GPU temperature is. If it's the first on the list, the SpeedFanNumber is 0 and if it's the second, it's 1 and so on.
