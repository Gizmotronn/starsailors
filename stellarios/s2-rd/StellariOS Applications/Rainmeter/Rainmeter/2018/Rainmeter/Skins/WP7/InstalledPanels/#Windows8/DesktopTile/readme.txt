Desktop Tile for Omnimo [BETA]

The first variant hides everything except itself, so you can click on it again to bring back everything.

The other one hides everything including itself, so in order to bring it back you need to execute the Show command. You can do this by right clicking the Rainmeter icon, selecting "Edit settings" and adding (replacing) this under [Rainmeter]:

TrayExecuteM=!execute [!Toggle *]

Save and refresh, then middle click the Rainmeter tray icon.
