About:

	The Lock widget allows you to lock/unlock all of your widgets. Locking 
	widgets prevents them from being moved by accident, unlocking widgets 
	allows for them to be moved and re-arranged.

Appearance:

	The Lock widget is meant to blend into the background. Therefore, its 
	default state is semi-transparent. When you hover over the Lock widget  
	with your mouse, it becomes opaque.
	
	There are two color options to choose from when using the Lock widget: 
	light (white) and dark (black). These options can be selected by 
	right-clicking the Lock widget, selecting "Custom skin actions" from 
	the menu that appears, and selecting either "Light icon" or 
	"Dark icon" depending on your preference.

	The Lock widget will appear as either a "locked" lock icon or an 
	"unlocked" lock icon, depending on the situation. If the widgets are 
	locked, the "locked" lock icon will be shown. If the widgets are not 
	locked, the "unlocked" lock icon will be shown.
	
Use:

	Click the Lock widget to cycle between "locked" and "unlocked" states.
	
	Right-click the Lock widget and select "Custom skin actions" to bring 
	up a list of self-explanatory options:
	
	--------------------------
	Light icon
	Dark icon

"Lost" Widget:

	If the Lock widget is loaded but cannot be located (e.g. white icon on 
	white background), you can right-click the Rainmeter "raindrop" icon 
	in the notification area (i.e. system tray), select 
	"Win10 Widgets\Lock", select "Custom skin actions" from the menu that 
	appears, and change the color of the widget by selecting either 
	"Light icon" or "Dark icon". This process should assist you in 
	locating the "lost" widget.

	If the widget is still "lost," you can change your background to a 
	contrasting solid color and this should make it apparent where the 
	widget is located. This can be accomplished by right-clicking the 
	desktop, selecting "Personalize", and choosing "Solid color" from the 
	"Background" drop-down menu. Then a contrasting color can be chosen from 
	the resulting color selections.
	
Thats it!
