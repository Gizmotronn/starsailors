add the following lines within the underscores to the top of all your rainmeter skins. separate it from the rest of the code with a line break:
________________

[Rainmeter]
Group=Honeycombs

________________
any skin with those lines will do a fade toggle when this button is pressed.


this is a derivative work of the regular honeycomb skins by APIIUM.
