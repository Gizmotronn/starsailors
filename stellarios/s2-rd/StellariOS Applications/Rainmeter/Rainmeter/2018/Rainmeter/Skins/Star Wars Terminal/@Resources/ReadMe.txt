======================================================================

This is my first Rainmeter skin I have ever made.  I have tried to 
test it and make sure it works on different computers.  If you have
any suggestions or issues, feel free to e-mail me at 
Farficugar@gmail.com with the subject of Star Wars Terminal Skin.  I 
did end up using some pieces from other skins I found online.
I have made sure to give credit to those person below.  Please take
a look at them and their Rainmeter Skin creations.  If you think that 
I used something of yours, please let me know and if so, I will add 
your name to credits. I hope you enjoy the Rainmeter skin.

                              Quick Fixes
======================================================================

1. If the Server Check is not working, try putting the paping.exe 
   located in the "@Resources/addons" fold into your 
   "Windows/System32" folder.  Then edit the Server Check and change
   the "PathToPaPing" variable to be "PaPing.exe" instead of 
   "#@#Addons/PaPing.exe".
   
2. If the Frame is not fitting your screen, simply Left Click it and
   it should refresh and fit to the screen.
