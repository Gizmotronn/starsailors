NOTICE:

	You are seeing this text document instead of a YouTube demonstration 
	video because there was a connection error. Please check your internet 
	connection and try again if you want to watch the video instead of 
	reading these instructions. The video is recommended since most people 
	find it easier to follow. The video can be found at this URL:

About:

	LayoutSwticher allows you to save two different Rainmeter layouts and 
	effortlessly switch between them. LayoutSwitcher can automatically 
	switch between layouts, or you can manually choose which layout to use 
	at any given time.
	
Layout descriptions:

	The first layout ("Layout 1") is meant to be used as a single screen 
	layout. Most people set "Layout 1" as their laptop layout. The second 
	layout ("Layout 2") is meant to be used as a dual screen layout. Most 
	people set "Layout 2" as their "laptop + monitor" layout.

	Summary:
		Layout 1 = Single screen (e.g. laptop) layout.
		Layout 2 = Dual screen (e.g. "laptop + monitor") layout.

Appearance:

	LayoutSwitcher is meant to blend into the background. Therefore, its 
	default state is semi-transparent. When you hover over LayoutSwitcher 
	with your mouse, it becomes opaque.

	There are two color options to choose from when using LayoutSwitcher: 
	light (white) and dark (black). These options can be selected by 
	right-clicking LayoutSwitcher, selecting "Custom skin actions" from 
	the menu that appears, and selecting either "Light icon" or 
	"Dark icon" depending on your preference.

	LayoutSwitcher will appear as either a laptop icon or a monitor icon, 
	depending on the situation. If only one screen is detected, the laptop
	icon will be shown. If two screens are detected, the monitor icon will
	be shown.

	Inside each icon will be either an "A", "1", or "2". 
	
	The "A" stands for "Auto-layout." When "A" is shown, "Layout 1" will 
	automatically be loaded when only one screen is detected and 
	"Layout 2" will be automatically be loaded when two screens are 
	detected.
	
	The "1" stands for "Layout 1" and the "2" stands for "Layout 2". When
	"1" is shown, "Layout 1" is active. When "2" is shown, "Layout 2" is 
	active.
	
	Summary (symbol key):
		A = Auto-layout
		1 = Layout 1
		2 = Layout 2
		Laptop icon = One screen detected
		Monitor icon = Two screens detected
	
Setup:

	The first time you use LayoutSwticher you will need to setup and save 
	your layouts. This is accomplished in two easy steps (per layout):

	Layout 1:
	1) Arrange your Rainmeter widgets to reflect how you want "Layout 1" 
	   to appear.
	2) Right-click the "LayoutSwitcher" widget, select 
	   "Custom skin actions", and then click "Set Layout 1 (Laptop)". 
	   This saves your first layout.
	
	Layout 2:
	1) Arrange your Rainmeter widgets to reflect how you want "Layout 2" 
	   to appear.
	2) Right-click the "LayoutSwitcher" widget, select 
	   "Custom skin actions", and then click "Set Layout 2 (Monitor)". 
	   This saves your second layout.

	Your layouts can be updated at any time by following these same 
	instructions.

Use:

	Click LayoutSwticher to cycle between "Layout 1", "Layout 2", and 
	"Auto-layout". 
	
	Right-click LayoutSwticher and select "Custom skin actions" to bring 
	up a list of self-explanatory options:
	
	--------------------------
	Auto-layout
	Load Layout 1 (Laptop)
	Load Layout 2 (Monitor)
	--------------------------
	Set Layout 1 (Laptop)
	Set Layout 2 (Monitor)
	--------------------------
	Light icon
	Dark icon
	--------------------------
	Help
	--------------------------
	
"Lost" Widget:

	If the Lock widget is loaded but cannot be located (e.g. white icon on 
	white background), you can right-click the Rainmeter "raindrop" icon 
	in the notification area (i.e. system tray), select 
	"Win10 Widgets\Lock", select "Custom skin actions" from the menu that 
	appears, and change the color of the widget by selecting either 
	"Light icon" or "Dark icon". This process should assist you in 
	locating the "lost" widget.

	If the widget is still "lost," you can change your background to a 
	contrasting solid color and this should make it apparent where the 
	widget is located. This can be accomplished by right-clicking the 
	desktop, selecting "Personalize", and choosing "Solid color" from the 
	"Background" drop-down menu. Then a contrasting color can be chosen from 
	the resulting color selections.

Thats it!
