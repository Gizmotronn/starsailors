Inspired by the Metro UI, Windows Phone 7, Windows 8 user interface. The project is not using, even partially, any code or images from Windows Phone 7. The graphics were created from scratch to resemble the ones of Windows Phone 7. Any resemblances to existing or future Microsoft(R) products are for customization purposes only, but also with an intention to raise awareness of the mentioned products within the community.
