First, download the MediaKey.DLL plugin: http://poiru.deviantart.com/art/MediaKey-Plugin-174230671

Put that in your Rainmeter Plugins folder, (C:\Program Files\Rainmeter\Plugins by default).

Next, copy the Zune folder into your Rainmeter Skins folder, (C:\Users\YOU\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins)

Load it up and there you go.  Now eat some cake.
