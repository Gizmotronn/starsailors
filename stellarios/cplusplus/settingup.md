## Setting up for C++

To create and edit C++ files, we're going to need a text editor. I'm going to be using  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Any text editor will work, but I'd recommend against using Microsoft Word, or google docs.

I'd recommend checking out this video here:

IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) are good text editors as well.
