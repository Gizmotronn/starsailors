# Cheat sheet


    Opus is actually a Cancrinite, but has every species
    White marble arm (made of siridium) – right arm
    Siridium arm –
        Controls the universe
        Siridium star (pulses different colours, but by default is gold) control panel
        Pressing the button allows Opus to select different modes:
        Universe hopper, Storage, Devices, Experiments, Droid cPanel, Droids, Spaceships, Collections, Communication, Aliens, Weapons)
        Each brings up a holographic display
        Cannot be removed
        Can store things
    Does kill people (after constructing arm), however their essence goes into universe hopper where they can start afresh
    Basically a gauntlet, with a spaceship
    Starbound-themed spaceship/tardis/starfighter
    Means Opus can live forever, universe is never destroyed, arm can’t be removed – everything can go into arm (and i mean everything from the entire multiverse network)
    Finds materials and constructs/develops arm at the end of the first book
    Planetary garden (finds planets in Chapter 7)
    Portal to star wars
