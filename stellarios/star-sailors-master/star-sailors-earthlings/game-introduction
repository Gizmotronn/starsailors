Welcome to our galaxy. Created by the Alliance of Droids, Star Sailors is what at first seems like a game for members of the Alliance of Droids. However, Star Sailors is much more than that. An imaginary galaxy full of planets, stars, nebulas, and beings mining minerals and living life, The Milky Way was previously home to a handful of life-bearing planets. Now it is the centre of a vast number of alien species that were drawn towards the Milky Way by an unknown source. One of those aliens was you.

Over the 14 billion years of the Universeâ€™s existence, and the 200 million years since the original humans went extinct, aliens are settling into the Milky Way, creating lives that they are proud of on different planets. Earth and the Solar System have been wiped from the face of the galaxy, however some astro-archaeologists believe traces of the human homeworld remain. All the other planets across the universe that have given rise to life have similarily been destroyed, but again historians have not given up on the search.

On your Solar Sailor Starship, you have come back from suspended animation and are descending to the galactic capital, Midgard. You now have to remember which homeworld you came from, your skills and personality, and your species.
