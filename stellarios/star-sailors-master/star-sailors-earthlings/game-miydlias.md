The Miydlias were the first species to succesfully colonize a large portion of the galaxy, and they did so roughly 15000 years ago. A war-loving people, the Miydlias were infamous for their conquests, where they would invade planets to further their cause.

After they left their homeworld (which has since been lost to our records) they settled on a volcanic planet called Miydli, which is where they got their name from. Over millenia, the Miydlias terraformed the planet to be the snowy capital of the galaxy that we called Midgard (of the Midgard Legacy).
