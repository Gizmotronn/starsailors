# The Chapter
The cabin was dark. Gilbert McInstay was searching for his space suit. He didn't like what "prepare for boarding" sounded like. *Where is it, where is it*, he thought over and over. Reaching into an unmarked supply bin, he felt some cloth. It was the space suits! 

For anyone that has never put on a space suit before,

Trying to record what had happened for the captain's log, Gilbert was typing furiously at his command console. Everything was locked down, and even as Gilbert typed, the screens he was facing darkened gradually until they were black.
Desperately, looking for something to log the message, he reached into his jacket and pulled out his comlink. He quickly turned it on and disabled its network functionality - *hopefully, if it's not on the network, it won't be shut down, like the other computers were*, he thought. Tapping at the screen, he swiped to the screen marked "Command" - it had just been installed onto his comlink by *insert first mate's name here*. He navigated to the app marked "Captain's Log" and began filming himself.

"Day 1 of my command" he began. "My name is Gilbert McInstay, currently the commander of the Scavenger Fleet. We were attempting to land on Earth when our command ship, including the previous commander, Opus *new last name - Opus only becomes Siridium in chapter 8", was apparently destroyed in a bright explosion. Alek Vicheva put me in command."
"Shortly after this, we received an extraterrestrial message. I am uploading its contents now. I will be boarding an extraterrestrial fleet's command module, as they commanded."

Opus put his comlink on the desk and the comlink automatically began the sequence that would upload its contents to the Scavenger network, which was located on the Scavenger's Planet of __Charilia__. He was pacing around his room when suddenly he heard a massive crash. He ran towards the source of the sound, outside the room. What he saw made his blood boil - almost literallly. 

Gilbert saw the starry sky, but not through a window. A massive hole had been blasted through the hull of his ship. He could see the exposed wires in the metre-sized hole, and if hadn't of  been wearing his space suit, he would have been dead. He only just managed to grab onto a handhold - a shelf - before he himself was wrenched out into space. But Gilbert's grip began to falter, and the force being applied was too strong. Gilbert was flung out through the hole at close to the speed of sound.
