  "The Force was an energy field that connected all living things in the galaxy. The power of the Force could be used by individuals who were sensitive to it, a power that was tapped through the midi-chlorians. The Force had many alternate names. The Lasats, for example, used to call it the Ashla, and described it as 'the spirit of the galaxy.' The Force as a recorded concept existed for well over 25,000 years. ",

  "Usage of the Force granted a number of useful powers, such as the ability to sense impending attacks; to push and lift physical objects; influence the thoughts of others, known as the 'Jedi mind trick'; and even see the future or maintain one's consciousness after death. Dark side users strong with the Force could summon lightning from their fingertips.",
  
  "Jedi taught younglings that the Force could be used for many purposes, including protection, persuasion, wisdom, the manipulation of matter and the performance of great physical feats."
