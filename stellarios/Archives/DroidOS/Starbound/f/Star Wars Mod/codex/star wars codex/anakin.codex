 "Anakin Skywalker was a Force-sensitive human male who served the Galactic Republic as a Jedi Knight, and later the Galactic Empire as the Sith Lord Darth Vader.",
 
 "Believed to have been conceived by the Force, he was born to Shmi Skywalker and moved to the Outer Rim world of Tatooine as a small child, where he and his mother were slaves to a Toydarian junk dealer named Watto.",
 
 "Skywalker was discovered by Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who freed Anakin from slavery via a wager on the youth's podracing skills.",
 
 "Skywalker secretly married his childhood love, Senator Padm√© Amidala. As the war progressed, Skywalker saw very little of Amidala, prizing the moments the two were able to share with one another.",
 
 "Early in the course of the war, the Jedi High Council assigned Skywalker a Padawan of his own, Ahsoka Tano; a gifted student who, much to Skywalker's chagrin, eventually left the Order.",
 
 "Towards the end of the war, Skywalker was blessed with the news of pending fatherhood, when Amidala announced she was carrying their first child.",
 
 "But this joy turned to an overwhelming sorrow, as Skywalker became plagued with visions of his wife's demise in childbirth. Anakin's desire to protect the ones he loved would drive him to the dark side of the Force.",
 
 "Skywalker betrayed the Jedi, pledging himself to the teachings of Darth Sidious, thus becoming the Sith Lord Darth Vader."
