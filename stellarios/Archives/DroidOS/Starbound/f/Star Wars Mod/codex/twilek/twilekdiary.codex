  "Twi'lek, sometimes referred to disparagingly as 'Tail-heads', were an omnivorous humanoid species originating from the planet Ryloth. They tended to eat cultivated molds,
  fungi, and rycrit meat. Their distinctive features included colorful skin, which varied in pigment from individual to individual, and a pair of shapely prehensile 
  tentacles that grew from the base of their skulls.",

"The natural grace and exotic beauty of the female Twi'leks made them a popular target among slave traders. Slavery was the main currency of Ryloth,
 which was tolerated by the Galactic Republic. Some saw it as a chance to make money by kidnapping or selling orphaned children, while others saw slavery as a way of
 saving children from growing up in Ryloth's harsh environment."
