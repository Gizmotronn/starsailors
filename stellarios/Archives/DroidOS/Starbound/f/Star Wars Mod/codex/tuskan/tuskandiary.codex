  "Tusken Raiders were a species native to the desert world of Tatooine. Their homeworld's harsh environment resulted in them being extremely xenophobic & territorial of their native resources, often attacking the outskirts of smaller settlements.",

Females could be distinguished by their elaborate jeweled masks with eyeslits and torso-covering sand-shrouds."
