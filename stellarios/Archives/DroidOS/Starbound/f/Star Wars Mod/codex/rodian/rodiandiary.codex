  "Rodians were a species of reptilian humanoids. They possessed large pupil-less eyes that could see in infrared spectrum, slender snouts, pointed ears, twin saucer-like antennae that detected vibrations atop their heads, and a ridge of spines cresting their skulls.
  Rodians also became notorious for working as bounty hunters ",

"Rodians evolved on the planet Rodia, and eventually joined the Galactic Republic by the time of the Invasion of Naboo."
