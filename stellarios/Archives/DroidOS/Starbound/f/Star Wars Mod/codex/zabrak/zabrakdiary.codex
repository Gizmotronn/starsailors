  "Zabraks were a near-human carnivorous species native to the planet Iridonia. The species had distinctive horns atop their heads and two hearts.",

"Although most male Zabraks lived on Iridonia, some lived on Dathomir under the rule of the Nightsisters.
Zabraks were considered to be proud, self-determined and even arrogant to some, yet they nevertheless were one of the most independent species in the galaxy."
