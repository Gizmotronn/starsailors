  "Bothans are furry mammalian anthropoids, about 1.5 meters tall. Hailing from Bothawui and several colonies, Bothans differed in facial appearance and body structure with
  canine, feline, and equine features. They were known for being master politicians and spies, craving intrigue and subterfuge.",

"Bothan culture was guided by the philosophy and principles set forth in the ancient text known as The Way, written by Golm Fervse'dra. In this 'Bothan Way',
 the pursuit of power and influence was paramount. Thus, individual Bothans put their own political and economic success above all other concerns, and as a species,
 Bothans put their own advancement ahead of other intergalactic interests, though many did side with the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil war."
