  "Toydarians are a race of winged mammalian beings from the planet Toydaria. Strong-willed, and resistant to manipulation of the mind through the
  Force, this species produced a body odor similar to sweetspice. With a reputation for being stingy and bad-tempered, many Toydarians were possessed
  of a strong sense of pride in their work. ",

"A common trait of all Toydarians was their shrewd business sense and their ability to haggle any deal. A loyal and proud people, these traits could
 be off-putting to outsiders, as many Toydarians in the galaxy were seen as crooks or slimy businessmen, but this was not always the case."
