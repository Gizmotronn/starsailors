  "Battle droids, also known as combat droids, were a type of droid designed for combat. Over the years, many different models of battle droid have been utilized by
  various factions throughout the galaxy. One such faction was the Confederacy of Independent Systems, which used a number of different models of battle droid during
  the Clone Wars to make up the Separatist Droid Army.",

"One thing all battle droids had in common was that they had limited intelligence. They were programmed to follow orders, and not much else, though they did have 
personalities. Some battle droids however, had some form of intelligence. These droids were much more expensive to make, due to their advanced brains."
