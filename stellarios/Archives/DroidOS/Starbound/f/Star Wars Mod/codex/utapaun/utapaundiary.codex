  "Pau'ans served as leaders early in their lives, often managing teams of Utai laborers. This gave them experience that would be used later in their life.
  Pau'an society was a blend of a variety of styles and cultures, borne from the ancient merger with the Utai. Built into the sinkhole walls. ",

"Pau'an civilization began around 57,000 BBY. It was believed that settlers traveled to Utapau hoping to find a hospitable world to colonize after the destruction of their homeworld."
