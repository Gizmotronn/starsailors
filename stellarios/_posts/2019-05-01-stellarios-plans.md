## Timeline
At the moment I'm going to be working with Grok, Sololearn and a youtube tutorial to learn C++. I'll be using codeblocks and visual studio to write the code. Check out [this page](http://acord-robotics.github.io/starsailors/docs) to see the code.

## Stellarios

Stellarios is the official operating system and app of ACORD. Stellarios will be designed to work on MacOS & Windows devices, and there will be apps created for Android, iOS & Linux devices. Stellarios is going to be a bundle of applications that will be used by ACORD Corporation members to perform certain operations.
Applications
Droid Control App

Our droids (companion, scientific, etc) will be able to be controlled from this part of Stellarios. Once you click on the button to send you to the droid control app, you will select the type of droid you want to pair with (companion, scientific), then the class (steampunk, et, etc), then the model name (Sp-D2, a0-d2, etc.

Once you've selected your droid, you will find a cross-section diagram of your droid with different parts highlighted -

    Legs = movement
    Holoprojector = talk/message (http://replika.ai)
    Dome/Head = Programs

Added post to Acord portal

Dome

Clicking on the dome will zoom in on the dome and give you a number of programs -

    Battery - low battery mode. The physical droid will turn off and send itself to your phone or device. This means you can interact with a virtual version of your droid
    Games - games like Star Sailors. Hosted on the app, and your offline progress sent to the servers. There will be online features too that require an internet connection
    Science - experiments, research, tools
    Writing/Drawing/Art
    will be able to control our droids and play or games, like A0-D2 and Star Sailors
    Can interact with replika.ai

Other applications

    Other games, mini-games

# Dev News - DROIDOS
## Sololearn
We recently hit our 6-day streak on Sololearn, meaning we had logged in and learnt some code for 6 days in a row. Over that period, we've learnt more of C++, so we are now about half-way through the basic concepts for C++.

## What tutorials will we be using for coding?
I've already mentioned Sololearn, which is a free-to-use website/app that has really great content and gives tutorials for 13 different languages, including C++, C, C#, Python, and Java. I banged through the HTML course on the way back from Brisbane (when I went to the Australian Space Design Finals), and I made notes (see DroidOS Development), however it didn't really stick in my memory. I think this is because of the way I made my notes and how rushed I was. I still understand the basics, and I'm going to be redoing that course.

I'm also looking for some other tutorial websites and other possible languages (see below).

## The future of DroidOS
As we had to change our name from Alliance of Droids to ACORD Robotics because of the word droid being trademarked, we're planning to also change the name of DroidOS. This name change will hopefully be in place by August across all platforms, however we've got a few possible names lined up:

* StellarOS
* RobOS
* AcordS
